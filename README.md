Plots from Portfolio Project at DSR

I am a Biologist whoworked in the field of infectious diseases and nutrition for several years.
Because of my backgroud for this project I decided to work with a dataset of the World Bank that contains data abput health, population, education and employment (373 indicators in total) from 217 countries from 1960 to 2015.

I used Kmeans algorithm to obtain cluster of countries over the years.
