Plots from Portfolio Project at Data Science Retreat

I am a Biologist who worked in the field of infectious diseases and nutrition for several years.
Because of my backgroud for this project I decided to work with a dataset of the World Bank that contains data about health, population, education and employment (373 indicators in total) from 217 countries from 1960 to 2015.

I used Kmeans algorithm to obtain clusters of countries over the years.
